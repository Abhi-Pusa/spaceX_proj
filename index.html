  <h1>The Space</h1>
<div class="grid_4">
  <p>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and
    events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often
    conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually
    consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum
    known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental
    importance to an understanding of the physical universe.
    In the seventeenth century, the philosophy of space and time emerged as a central issue in epistemology
    and metaphysics. At its heart, Gottfried Leibniz, the German philosopher-mathematician, and Isaac Newton,
    the English physicist-mathematician, set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an
    entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the
    collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places
    taken together".
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="grid_4">
 <p>Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back
   to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his
   reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the Physics of
   Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later
   "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place
   (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen. Many of these classical
   philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the
   17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac
   Newton's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently
   of whether there was any matter in the space. Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried
   Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects,
   given by their distance and direction from one another.
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="grid_4">
   <p>In the 18th century, the philosopher
     and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his
     Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that neither
     space nor time can be empirically perceived—they are elements of a systematic framework that
     humans use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to "space" in his Critique of Pure
     Reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition", hence it is an unavoidable
     contribution of our human faculties.In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are not Euclidean,
     in which space can be said to be curved, rather than flat. According to Albert Einstein's theory of
     general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental
     tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the
     shape of space.

      Spaceflight (also written space flight) is ballistic flight into or through outer space. Spaceflight can
      occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite
      telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance
      satellites and other Earth observation satellites.

    <h2>Mission 2</h2>
    <p>
      A robotic spacecraft is an unmanned spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft
      designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are
      more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In
      addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human
      survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to
      reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.
    </p>
    <!--p>
      Many artificial satellites are robotic spacecraft, as are many landers and rovers.
      A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the
      force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of
      a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics.
      Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a
      planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.
